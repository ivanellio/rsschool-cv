## **About myself**

I am a third year student at BSUIR. I study at the Faculty of Electronics and Computer Technologies.

After some attempts to find myself in the field of design and animation, I came to the conclusion that front-end development is closer to me.

I consider myself communicative, hardworking, assiduous. I can work productively alone, but I feel better in a team.  I like to work for the result, to make impact, and in general to be useful in the team.
